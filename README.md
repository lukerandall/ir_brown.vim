# ir_brown #

ir_brown is my modified version of ir_black. It has a grey background,
which I find less harsh on the eyes. It also swaps out a couple of
the colours used for slightly more pleasing versions. Apart from
that it is mostly the same.

## Installation ##

I recommend using [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/lukerandall/ir_brown.vim.git

then adding the following to your .vimrc

    colorscheme ir_brown
